# manufacturing_tool_wear_prediction
Project in Manufacturing Industry

This project was developed in my internship as a research assistant at WZL, the Laboratory for Machine Tools and Production Engineering of RWTH Aachen University, Germany. 

Working as a Student Research Assistant in a project related to the Monitoring of cutting processes, I was able to build Machine Learning (ML) models for predicting force, torque and tool wear conditions. Here's what I was able to bring to the project:

1. Developed algorithms in Python for the: pre-processing of Acoustic Emission Signals, Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis, Wavelet analysis, statistical features extraction, dimension reduction, feature importance, ranking and features selection.

2. Supervised regressive ML models such as: Linear Regressor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron / Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressor and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

3. Validated, ranked and trained models using Cross validation, improving them by Grid search and Feature Selection techniques.

4. Predicted force, torque and tool wear conditions of drilling process using the trained models, achieving attractive, but confidential results for the research group.

Tools: Python | Anaconda Navigator | Spyder | Jupyter | Numpy | Pandas | Scipy | Scikit-Learn | tsfresh| matplotlib

** Python files will be released in May 2021.
